### Rules for Virtual NPCs, Avatar Logic, and Behavioural Glitches in **Virtu-Awake**

This document defines how **NPCs within simulations** behave, feel, break, or respond during Virtu-Awake sessions.  
NPCs are core narrative devices: they reflect the pawn’s psychology, environment stability, and their progression through Awakening tiers.

NPCs include:
- Simulation inhabitants (“VR civilians”)  
- Role-specific agents in training sims  
- Abstract dream-figures in psychological sims  
- Social avatars (user-to-user)  
- Echoes (glitch-duplicates of pawns)  

NPC behaviour must always reinforce Virtu-Awake’s **subtle psychological storytelling**.

# 🧠 1. What NPCs Are (and Aren’t)

NPCs are **constructed perceptual entities**, not:
- Real intelligences  
- AI in the sci-fi sense  
- Sentient beings  
- “Ghosts” unless metaphorical  

Their behaviour is *felt*, not explained:
- They occupy roles  
- They follow simple loops  
- They embody the tone of the simulation  
- They glitch as Instability grows  
- They respond (subtly) to pawn traits  

NPCs are dreamlike, not technological.

# 👥 2. Categories of NPCs

### **1. Ambient NPCs**
Generic background characters.
- Limited animation set  
- Soft presence  
- Cyclic behaviour  

Appear in:
- Recreational sims  
- Social VR spaces  
- Calm dreamscapes  

---

### **2. Functional NPCs**
Exist for specific roles, such as:
- Combat instructors  
- Simulated patients  
- Merchants  
- Training targets  

They behave predictably **until instability rises**.

---

### **3. Abstract NPCs**
Found in psychological sims:
- Faceless silhouettes  
- Figures made of light, dust, or text  
- Shifting outlines  
- Variants of the pawn’s own avatar  

These are symbolic, not literal.

---

### **4. Social VR Avatars (Real pawns in VR)**
When two pawns share a linked sim:
- They see stylised versions of each other  
- Subtle desyncs are normal  
- Speech is transmitted as emotionally-smeared impressions  
- Physical gestures can become exaggerated or simplified  

They are not perfect replicas.

---

### **5. Echo NPCs (Glitch Duplicates)**
Rare phenomena:
- A second version of the pawn appears  
- Movements lag behind  
- Expression slightly wrong  
- Sometimes staring directly at the pawn  

These are high-tier Awakening anomalies.

---

# 🔄 3. Behaviour Rules for NPCs

NPCs must behave:
- Calmly  
- Softly  
- With understated mannerisms  
- With minimal animation complexity  

They should never:
❌ Explain the simulation  
❌ React to glitches as if aware  
❌ Exhibit strong emotional displays  
❌ Use comedic dialogue  
❌ Break the fourth wall  

NPC behaviour is part of the *illusion*.

# 🧩 4. NPC Behaviour by Instability Level

### **Stable**
- NPCs walk smooth loops  
- Voices soft, slightly muted  
- Eye contact minimal but natural  
- Ambient chatter feels warm and safe  

---

### **Low Instability**
- Slightly repetitive lines  
- Micro-stutters in animation  
- Incorrect blinking patterns  
- Perfectly looping gestures  

Memory example:  
> *“The vendor repeated the same smile twice, like it forgot it had already done it.”*

---

### **Medium Instability**
- Pathfinding loops  
- NPCs freeze momentarily  
- Idle animations trigger at wrong times  
- Voices overlap or stutter  

Memory example:  
> *“Two NPCs started walking in perfect sync, then drifted apart like marionettes.”*

---

### **High Instability**
- Faces blank out  
- Eye contact too intense or misaligned  
- Identical NPCs appear  
- Gesture desync (hands move without intent)  
- NPCs turn slightly toward the pawn without prompt  

Memory example:  
> *“An NPC stood perfectly still for too long. When it finally moved, it was like a puppet catching up to a missed cue.”*

---

### **Crisis**
- NPCs ignore the pawn entirely  
- NPCs turn to look “past” the pawn  
- Whole crowds freeze  
- All ambience stops  
- NPCs vanish when not looked at  
- Echo NPCs appear  

Memory example:  
> *“Every NPC turned their head at once, but not to me — to something behind me that I couldn’t see.”*

---

# 👤 5. Avatar Behaviour (Pawn’s Own Body in VR)

A pawn’s virtual self may glitch too.

### Low-tier anomalies:
- Slight hand delay  
- Footsteps not matching ground  
- Voice muffled  

### Mid-tier anomalies:
- Avatar movement desyncs  
- Shadow incorrect  
- Mouth animations wrong  

### High-tier anomalies:
- Avatar appears before the pawn moves  
- Double reflections  
- Seeing the avatar from “outside”  

### Crisis-tier:
- Pawn sees a second self (Echo)  
- Avatar disappears  
- Avatar performs actions the pawn didn’t make  
- Avatar “clips” through environment  
- Avatar blinks out of sequence  

These are always **psychological**, not literal VR code errors.

---

# 🔮 6. Trait-Based NPC Perception

Traits should colour NPC interpretation:

### **Psychopath**
- Calmly notes anomalies  
- Finds NPC glitches “fascinating”  

### **Neurotic**
- Feels unsafe when NPCs misbehave  
- Early panic memories  

### **Sanguine**
- Laughs softly, reframes NPC loops positively  

### **Depressive**
- Interprets glitching NPCs as symbols of decay  

### **TooSmart**
- Attempts to deduce pattern behaviour  
- Notices early signs of underlying logic  

### **PsySensitive**
- Feels “presence” behind NPC actions  
- Interprets NPCs as symbolic messengers  

---

# 🎭 7. Social VR NPC Rules (Real Pawn Interaction)

When two pawns interact:
- Gestures may drift or be exaggerated  
- Voices are represented as emotional colour rather than words  
- Slight timing mismatches occur  
- They may receive synchronised hallucinations at high instability  

Memory example:  
> *“We looked at each other and our avatars blurred, like we were sharing the same thought for a moment.”*

Avoid realism; social VR is impressionistic.

---

# 🌀 8. Echo NPC Rules (Glitch Duplicates)

Echoes are rare, powerful, and must follow strict rules:
- They never speak  
- They do not attack  
- They mimic imperfectly  
- They appear in peripheral vision  
- They vanish abruptly or freeze  
- Pawns gain strong Awakening memories  
- Trait variants heavily modify interpretation  

Echoes are NOT:
❌ Ghosts  
❌ Demons  
❌ Clones  
❌ Past selves  

They are symbolic anomalies.

---

# 💬 9. NPC Dialogue Rules

NPC dialogue must be:
- Minimal  
- Fragmentary  
- Soft  
- Repetitive  
- Generic  
- Non-informative  

Examples:
- “Hello there.”  
- “A beautiful day.”  
- “I’m going this way.”  
- “See you again.”  

Glitched examples:
- “Hel— hel— hello.”  
- “A day. A day. A day.”  
- “Going this… this… going…”  
- Silence + mouth movement  

Never provide lore, answers, or clear explanations.

---

# 🛑 10. Forbidden NPC Content

NPCs must never:
- Show gore or violence  
- Express explicit awareness of being simulated  
- Give coherent explanations  
- Display strong emotions (anger, terror, etc.)  
- Break the illusion with meta-humour  
- Reference Earth names, technologies, or culture  

NPCs are dream-constructs.

---

# ✔ Summary

NPCs in Virtu-Awake must always feel:

- Calm  
- Soft  
- Dreamlike  
- Slightly off  
- Responsive to instability  
- Interpreted through pawn psychology  
- Never fully sentient  
- Never fully stable  
- And never fully explained  

NPC behaviour is one of the mod's richest narrative tools.  
Use it to deepen immersion, build atmosphere, and guide pawns through Awakening.
