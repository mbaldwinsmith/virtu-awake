### Cross-Reference System for Generating VR Memories for All Simulation Types in **Virtu-Awake**

This document defines the **Memory Scaffold** — a multi-dimensional framework for generating consistent, tone-accurate VR memories.

It ensures that all memory text:
- Matches each SimType  
- Aligns with Instability and Lucidity  
- Reacts to traits  
- Scales with Awakening tiers  
- Uses correct glitch classes  
- Preserves Virtu-Awake psychological tone  
- Avoids lore violations, explicit horror, realism, or exposition

# 🧠 1. What the Memory Scaffold Is

The Memory Scaffold is a **content-coordination system**.  
It organises memory generation using:

- Simulation Type  
- Severity Tier  
- Instability Level  
- Lucidity Level  
- Awakening Tier  
- Trait Modifiers  
- Glitch Class  
- Legendary or Underlayer flags  

This system **never represents literal code**, and is purely a design reference.

# 🧩 2. The Seven Memory Dimensions

Every memory is influenced by several axes:

1. **SimType** (environmental experience)
2. **Experience Tier** (severity of the moment)
3. **Instability** (reality thinness)
4. **Lucidity** (awareness)
5. **Awakening Tier** (psychological progression)
6. **Trait Modifier** (tone shifts)
7. **Glitch Class** (S/T/C/U)

# 🔺 4. Experience Severity Tiers

1. **Minor Moment** – tiny flicker or oddity  
2. **Noticeable Shift** – uncanny but manageable  
3. **Significant Distortion** – dissociation or pattern break  
4. **Deep Crack** – glimpses of deeper layers  
5. **Crisis** – full perceptual rupture  

---

# ⚙ 5. Instability Levels

0 — Stable  
1 — Light distortion  
2 — Strong distortion  
3 — Catastrophically thin  

---

# 🧭 6. Lucidity Influence

Low — dreamy acceptance  
Medium — curiosity, noticing seams  
High — sharp awareness, pre-breakthrough  

---

# ⚡ 7. Awakening Tier Influence

Tier 1 — soft, compliant  
Tier 2 — noticing inconsistencies  
Tier 3 — dissociation  
Tier 4 — revelation  
Tier 5 — rupture/breakout themes  

---

# 🎭 8. Trait Variants

Each memory should allow tonal variants for:

- Psychopath  
- Neurotic  
- Sanguine  
- Depressive  
- BodyPurist  
- TooSmart  
- PsySensitive  
- Brawler  
- Ascetic  
- Gourmand  
- Kind / Calm  

Not all need unique lines, but tone must shift.

# 🎨 9. Glitch Classes

(from GLITCH_ARCHITECTURE.md)

- **Class-S:** surface distortions  
- **Class-T:** structural anomalies  
- **Class-C:** cognitive distortions  
- **Class-U:** underlayer bleed

# 🌟 11. Memory Themes per SimType

### **Recreation**
Warm surrealism.  
Nature patterns bending softly.

### **Training**
Timing errors, motion desync, echoing steps.

### **Psychological**
Identity friction, mirror misalignment, geometric drift.

### **Social**
Avatar desync, shared emotional colours, double-vision moments.

### **Advanced**
Archeotech ambience, symbolic visions, layered realities.

# 📘 15. Example Memory Scaffolds

### Recreation — Starlight Field  
Severity: 2  
Instability: 1  
Base:  
> *“One star flickered twice. The rhythm felt almost intentional.”*

PsySensitive:  
> *“The flicker felt like someone breathing through the sky.”*

---

### Psychological — Mirror Rooms  
Severity: 4  
Base:  
> *“My reflection paused while I kept moving. It knew I’d notice.”*

---

### Advanced — Archeotech Archive  
Severity: 5  
Legendary: true  
> *“The shelves folded inward, revealing a place older than any memory.”*

# ✔ 16. Purpose Summary

The Memory Scaffold ensures all VR memories are:

- psychologically coherent  
- trait-sensitive  
- surreal, subtle, soft  
- lore-preserving  
- consistent across systems  
- never expositional  
- never referencing external fiction  
- never breaking tone
