# **Virtu-Awake Roadmap**
*Projected development roadmap for features, systems, and long-term goals.*

This document outlines planned features, prioritised development stages, and long-term ambitions for the Virtu-Awake project. Timelines are flexible; the focus is on stable, extensible systems and high-quality storytelling.

---

# 🧩 **Phase 1 — Core Systems (MVP Release)**  
**Status:** In progress

### ✔ VR Pod Basics
- Recreation use
- Trait-aware memory generation
- Skill-based VR training (SimTypes)
- Social VR sessions (two-pawn scenes)

### ✖ Virtu-Dream Pods (removed)
- Long-term immersion
- Nutrient pipe support (VFE integration)
- Suspended animation logic

### ✔ Psychological Systems
- Need: **Lucidity**
- Hediff: **Simulation Instability** (3–4 stages)
- Awakening tiers (Compliant → Flicker → Dissociation → Realisation → Breakthrough)

### ✔ VR Event Engine (v1)
- Minor → Moderate → Major anomaly events
- Trait-influenced outcomes
- Simple Crisis events
- Early breakout attempts

# 🚧 **Phase 2 — Narrative Depth & Event Expansion**  
**Status:** Planned

### 🔸 VR Event Engine (v2)
- Full event registry & XML-driven definitions
- Event weighting based on traits + instability
- Multi-event chains (Prophet, Breaker, Haunted)
- Environmental VR anomalies (lights flicker, power surges)
- Catastrophic multi-pod glitch events

### 🔸 Memory Library Expansion
- Legendary glitch memories
- Trait-combo memories (2–3 traits)
- Rare long-form VR experiences
- Social memory variants (friendship, rivalry, romance)

### 🔸 New Simulation Types
- Inner Childhood Memory sim
- Cosmic Void / Deep Meditation sim
- Creative Sandbox (artistic xp)
- Healing Garden (mood recovery)
- Dream Maze (intellectual xp)
- Combat Arenas (melee & shooting xp)

### 🔸 Storyteller Integration (optional)
- Small chance of VR events influencing colony events
- Psychic events interacting with VR instability

---

# 🔧 **Phase 3 — Systems Expansion & Balance**  
**Status:** Planned

### 🔸 Breakout System (v2)
- Path-based breakout behaviour (Prophet, Breaker, Haunted)
- Pawn sabotage preferences (power, pods, doors)
- Escape attempts tied to traits
- “Digital Afterimages” hallucination effect post-breakout

### 🔸 Advanced Instability Mechanics
- Persistent glitches visible to all colonists
- Sync errors between pods
- Flickering visual overlays (optional graphics setting)

### 🔸 Gameplay Balance Pass
- XP tuning for VR training
- Mood gains vs. long-term side-effects
- Prisoner management balance
- Late-game VR dependency mechanics

---

# 🌌 **Phase 4 — Faction, Lore & World Integration**  
**Status:** Conceptual

### 🔸 Virtu-Awake Lore Expansion
- Ancient tech hints
- Simulation artifacts
- Hidden messages in VR visions

### 🔸 New Faction (optional future module)
**The Wakened**  
- Survivors who broke from virtual life  
- Psychic-resonance ideology  
- Fear or worship of VR technology  

### 🔸 World Quests
- Rescue a pawn trapped in a corrupted VR pod  
- Recover schematics for “Prime Simulation Core”  
- Investigate ruins with VR echoes of past events  

### 🔸 Royalty & Ideology Integration (deep)
- VR meditation role  
- Rituals performed inside VR  
- Psycast anomalies linked to instabilities  

---

# 🧠 **Phase 5 — Polishing & Modding Framework**  
**Status:** Future goal

### 🔸 Modding API
- Expose SimTypes as defs
- Expose events, memories, and glitch tiers
- Support custom VR training mods
- Hooks for modders to add:
  - New VR scenes
  - New trait-memories
  - New anomaly events

### 🔸 UI & UX Enhancements
- VR status panel for each pawn
- Lucidity/Instability bars in inspect tab
- VR event popups with subtle effects

### 🔸 Performance Improvements
- Tick optimisation for large colonies
- Graceful fallbacks for heavy glitch events

---

# 🧪 **Experimental / Stretch Goals**

### 🚀 Neural-Layer Puppeting
- Pawn temporarily gains “VR buffs” outside the pod  
- Memory bleed: skills or mood stability influenced by their VR persona  

### 🔮 Digital Echoes
- Rare glitch leaves a persistent invisible “presence”  
- Harmless or harmful depending on traits  
- Colony-wide surreal story arcs  

### ⛓️ Shared Dream Network
- Multiple pods linked  
- Group VR events  
- “Hive-mind” instability chain reactions
