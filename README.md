# Virtu-Awake
Immersive VR pods, psychological storytelling, and simulation horror for RimWorld.

Virtu-Awake adds virtual-reality pods that deliver recreation, skill training, social scenes, and long-form VR dreaming. Pawns gain trait-aware memories, build lucidity, risk instability, and may even break out when they realise the world is fake.
