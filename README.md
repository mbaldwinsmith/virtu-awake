# **Virtu-Awake**
### *Immersive VR Pods, Psychological Storytelling & Simulation Horror for RimWorld*

**Virtu-Awake** introduces a suite of advanced virtual-reality pods that let your pawns experience entire worlds inside their minds. From joyful recreation to intense skill training, social meetings, suspended VR dreaming and ethically dubious “permanent simulations,” Virtu-Awake adds deep psychological flavour, glitch events, rare awakenings, and emergent sci-fi narratives to RimWorld.

If you enjoy mood thoughts, storytelling depth, pawn psychology, or gently-haunting weird fiction… this mod was built for you.

## 📦 **Features Overview**

### ✔ **VR Pods – immersive recreation & training**
Pawns can enter VR pods for:
- Recreation & mood recovery  
- Skill-based training (Combat, Crafting, Artistic, Nature, Medicine, Social, Intellectual, etc.)  
- Unique, RimWorld-style **memory thoughts**  
- Trait-aware VR experiences  
- Social VR scenes where two pawns meet in a shared simulation

### ✔ **Virtu-Dream Pods – suspended VR life**
Designed for long-term immersion:
- Keep colonists or prisoners in a stable VR world  
- Optional integration with nutrient pipe systems (VFE)  
- Use ethically… or not  

### ✔ **Awakening System (Lucidity & Instability)**
Long immersion builds:
- **Lucidity** – awareness that the VR world is fake  
- **Instability** – cracks, glitches, distortions  

Together they create five escalating psychological tiers:
1. Compliant  
2. Flicker  
3. Dissociation  
4. Realisation  
5. Breakthrough  

At higher tiers, pawns experience:
- Visual glitches  
- Memory fragments  
- Identity disturbances  
- Strange voices  
- Digital doubles  
- Surreal events  
- Terrifying “Reality Collapse” visions

### ✔ **Breakouts**
At maximum lucidity, pawns may:
- Force-eject from the pod  
- Enter panic, flee, or attack  
- Sabotage VR equipment  
- Free other VR users  
- Escape the colony  

High-risk. High-storytelling value.

- **Depressive:** sees the cracks as metaphors  
- **Pyromaniac:** loves glitch-fire  
- **Wimp:** terrified by minor flickers  

Also included:
- Dual-trait memories  
- Triple-trait legendary events  
- “Digital Prophet” psychic arcs  
- “Simulation-Breaker” glitch-weaponisation arcs  
- “Haunted by the Glitch” psychological unraveling

- Harmless visual anomalies  
- Distressing glitch events  
- Reality distortions  
- World stutters

- Catastrophic VR collapses  
- Breakout events  

Pawn experiences differ based on:

## ✨ **Lore Summary**

Humanity once dreamed of perfect simulation.  
But deep within Virtu-Awake pods, minds drift further than intended.  
Pawns learn, play, dream… but some start noticing the patterns.  
Some hear whispers behind the static.  
Some find the seams.  
Some meet themselves.  
Some become prophets.

And some wake—  
violently.
