### Internal Logic, Layers, and Behavioural Rules for Glitches in **Virtu-Awake**

This document describes the **architecture of glitches** in Virtu-Awake — the unseen logic behind how distortions appear, how they escalate, and how they interact with Lucidity, Instability, power anomalies, and Awakening tiers.

It is not literal code architecture.  
It is the *narrative and psychological architecture* that guides how glitches should feel and behave.

# 🧠 1. What a Glitch *Is*

In Virtu-Awake, glitches are **perceptual distortions**, not:
- bugs,
- coding errors,
- or system failures.

They are:
- cracks in the illusion,  
- thin points in the dreamlayer,  
- permutations of emotional and psychic resonance,  
- reflections of Instability,  
- manifestations of overloaded archeotech substrates.

Glitches always affect **the pawn’s mind first**, worldspace second.

The world doesn’t “break” — their perception of it bends.

# 🧬 2. The Three-Layer Model of Simulation Reality

Glitches follow a layered structure.  
Writers and developers must think in **layers**, even if pawns never see them.

### **Layer 1 — Surface Simulation**
The visible VR space:
- scenery  
- NPCs  
- ambient loops  
- simulated tasks  
- training chambers  

Glitches here are simple, visual, recognisable.

---

### **Layer 2 — Structural Simulation**
Beneath the surface are the **patterns that shape experience**:
- path loops  
- rhythm cycles  
- behavioural templates  
- motion-delays  
- horizon grids  
- room anchoring points  

Glitches at this layer feel:
- wrong  
- uncanny  
- patterned  
- algorithmic (but never explicitly described as such)

These are mid-tier Awakening signals.

---

### **Layer 3 — The Underlayer (Archeotech Substrate)**
This is not code or hardware.  
It is an ancient, semi-psychic, semi-organic substrate that:
- shapes world coherence  
- reacts to pawn temperament  
- stores echoes of previous users  
- mirrors thought patterns  
- resonates with psychic sensitivity  

Glitches here are:
- symbolic,  
- surreal,  
- identity-challenging,  
- awakening-tier,  
- deeply disturbing in a quiet way.

Examples:
- Echo NPCs  
- world peeling  
- layered realities  
- seeing the pod through the sky  
- hearing a voice not meant for them  

The Underlayer is never explained.  
It is *felt*, not understood.

# 🌀 3. Four Classes of Glitches

All glitches fit into one or more of these classes:

---

## **A. Surface Glitches (Class-S)**
Simple distortions.

Examples:
- flickers  
- animation loops  
- texture popping  
- haze shifts  
- colour washout  
- sound clipping  

Triggered by:
- low Instability  
- mild power fluctuation  
- early Awakening  

Tone:
- subtle  
- ignorable  
- “I imagined it.”  

---

## **B. Structural Glitches (Class-T)**
Breaks in the underlying pattern.

Examples:
- NPCs freezing  
- pathfinding loops  
- horizon repeating  
- gravity drift  
- room size changing subtly  
- avatar lag  

Triggered by:
- medium Instability  
- Lucidity rising above 0.5  
- power brownouts  

Tone:
- uncanny  
- disorienting  
- identity friction  

---

## **C. Cognitive Glitches (Class-C)**
Distortions inside the pawn’s awareness.

Examples:
- double-vision of scenes  
- memories out of order  
- déjà vu or jamais vu  
- emotional echoes  
- seeing through textures  
- hearing speech that isn’t speech  

Triggered by:
- Lucidity high (>0.7)  
- psychological sims  
- long immersion  
- personality traits  

Tone:
- intimate  
- personal  
- unsettling but not hostile  

---

## **D. Underlayer Glitches (Class-U)**
Deepest tier: ruptures in the archeotech substrate.

Examples:
- Echo NPCs  
- avatar behaving autonomously  
- world peeling  
- layer bleed (seeing overlapping realities)  
- blank voids  
- “presence” without form  
- glimpses of outside the pod  

Triggered by:
- Instability Stage 3  
- Awakening Tier 4–5  
- critical power drain  
- psycaster resonance  

Tone:
- existential  
- symbolic  
- never explained  
- never literal  

These lead to **breakouts**.

# 🔄 4. Escalation Logic

Glitches escalate through predictable psychological arcs.

### Stage 1 → Minor anomalies  
Surface (Class-S)  
> Flickers, loops, soft distortions.

### Stage 2 → Noticeable uncanny  
Structural (Class-T)  
> NPCs freezing, sound desync.

### Stage 3 → Dissociation  
Cognitive (Class-C)  
> Memory drift, body/avatar mismatch.

### Stage 4 → Cracking  
Underlayer influence (Class-U)  
> Ghost-lines of geometry, thin sky.

### Stage 5 → Rupture (Breakout)  
Full Underlayer breach  
> World folds, echoes stare, pawn ejects.

This escalation is always:
- paced,  
- subtle,  
- character-driven,  
- emotionally coherent.

Never abrupt without cause.

# 🧠 5. Trait Influences on Glitch Interpretation

Traits do not change glitches themselves —  
they change **how pawns interpret** them.

### Psychopath  
Analytical, curious.  
Sees glitches as puzzles.

### TooSmart  
Recognises pattern breaks earlier.  
Feels structural glitches sooner.

### Neurotic  
Anxious response.  
Interprets minor glitches as threats.

### Sanguine  
Finds beauty in distortions.  
Calmed by surreal ambience.

### Depressive  
Sees decay, dissolution.  
Feels existential dread sooner.

### PsySensitive  
Feels Underlayer pressure.  
Experiences resonance events.

Trait interplay is a storytelling engine.

# 🧩 6. Glitch Motifs (Allowed Patterns)

Use these motifs when writing glitches:

### Visual
- wireframe flashes  
- doubled silhouettes  
- mirror-lag  
- flickering horizon  
- texture thinning  
- blank areas  
- ripple distortions  
- overexposed light  

### Auditory
- static hiss  
- delayed footsteps  
- reverb on NPC speech  
- truncated voices  
- ambient hum cutting out  
- layered whispers  

### Spatial
- corridor loops  
- stairs leading nowhere  
- distance mismatch  
- objects shifting slightly  

### Cognitive
- déjà vu  
- sudden emptiness  
- momentary clarity  
- fragmentary thought echos  

All motifs must be:
- soft  
- psychological  
- dreamlike  
- never violent  

---

# 🔮 7. Legendary Glitch Forms (Ultra-Rare)

These occur only at extreme Instability + Awakening Tier 5:

### **1. The Frozen Crowd**
All NPCs freeze mid-motion.  
Their expressions are soft, blank, and almost compassionate.

### **2. The Pale Mesh**
The entire world becomes a faint lattice for 1–2 seconds.

### **3. The Watching Outline**
A faint silhouette appears at extreme distance, unmoving.

### **4. The Split Self**
An Echo NPC turns and “sees” the pawn directly.  
Only for an instant.

### **5. The Folded Sky**
Two skies briefly overlap, offset by a few degrees.

These should be felt as:
- profound  
- symbolic  
- unforgettable  
- unexplained  

---

# 🚫 8. Forbidden Glitches

Absolutely never include:
- gore  
- enemy monsters  
- violent hallucinations  
- cosmic horror entities  
- explicit “AI uprising” behaviour  
- code/terminal overlays  
- Earth-referenced glitches  
- meta humour  
- system explanations  

Virtu-Awake is about **perception**, not technology.

# ✔ Summary

The glitch architecture of Virtu-Awake is:

- Layered  
- Psychological  
- Dreamlike  
- Trait-reactive  
- Symbolic  
- Quietly unsettling  
- Never literal  
- Never fully explained  

Glitches are not bugs.  
They are **fractures in the pawn’s understanding**,  
moments where the truth becomes thin,  
and signals that Awakening is near.
