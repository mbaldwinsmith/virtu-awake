### Personality-Modulated VR Perception for **Virtu-Awake**

Every pawn interprets VR distortions through the lens of their personality.  
This compendium defines how each trait alters tone, perception, and emotional colour in VR memories.

Trait variants must always:
- alter **tone**, not objective events  
- remain subtle and psychological  
- avoid comedy, meta, exposition, or hard sci-fi  
- obey all Virtu-Awake style and lore rules  

This is the definitive palette for trait-driven VR memory flavour.
