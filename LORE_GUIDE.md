### Worldbuilding, Narrative Tone & Canonical Boundaries for **Virtu-Awake**

This guide defines the *internal lore rules* of Virtu-Awake.  
It describes **what the simulation is**, **how pawns interpret it**, **what is known**, **what is unknowable**, and **how writers should construct consistent, subtle lore** without revealing too much.

This file is intended for writers, developers, and AI agents generating content.

# 🌑 1. Lore Philosophy

Virtu-Awake follows a **“soft-lore”** approach:
- Hints, fragments, and partial truths  
- No direct exposition  
- No omniscient narrator  
- The player sees only what pawns experience  
- The mod never states the “real truth”  

Lore must be conveyed through:
- VR memories  
- Glitch events  
- Instability hallucinations  
- Rare cryptic messages  
- Building descriptions  
- Subtle environmental effects  

**Never explain the system outright.  
Never define what is truly real or unreal.**

# 🧭 2. What the Colonists Know

Pawns understand the VR pods at a surface level:
- They know these are simulation chambers  
- They know pods provide recreation and training  
- They know suspension pods exist for long-term immersion

They **do not** know:
- How the simulation is generated  
- Where the boundaries of VR end and the mind begins  
- What causes the glitches  
- Whether the VR is purely software or something deeper  

Their understanding is *naive and experiential.*

---

# 🧠 3. What the Player Knows

The mod deliberately avoids explaining whether:
- VR glitches are bugs  
- Instability is psychological or metaphysical  
- High-lucidity events are hallucinations or revelations  
- Something conscious exists behind the sim  

Players must remain uncertain.

---

# 🐾 4. What is Canon (Foundational Lore)

These points form the **canonical backbone** of Virtu-Awake:

### ✔ The VR system is ancient technology  
Even if colonists believe they built it, something deeper in its architecture predates them.  
This is conveyed only through:
- Old error logs  
- Deprecated subroutine names  
- Strange behaviours  

### ✔ Simulations run on a semi-organic neural substrate  
They are not “code” in the traditional sense.  
They respond unpredictably to:
- Psychic sensitivity  
- Emotional instability  
- Trait combinations  

### ✔ Instability is both glitch and psychological bleed  
It affects:
- The simulation fabric  
- The pawn’s perception  
- The intersection between mind and environment  

### ✔ Lucidity reveals seams in either the simulation or the pawn’s mind  
The mod never clarifies which.

### ✔ Rare events (“digital entities”, “voices”, “faces in the void”)  
Are left undefined.  
They may be:
- Echoes of previous users  
- Residual thoughtforms  
- Failing systems  
- Something else entirely  

---

# 🫣 5. What Must Never Be Defined

The following elements **must remain ambiguous forever**:

- Is the VR simulation artificially created or discovered tech?  
- Are the “voices” and “entities” intelligent?  
- Is high-lucidity perception real or delusional?  
- Did someone build the system… or does it evolve on its own?  
- Do the pods manipulate memory intentionally?  
- Are breakouts self-driven or system-driven events?  
- What lies “outside” the simulation during catastrophic glitches?  

Keeping these undefined is essential to the psychological tone.

# 🌀 6. Themes Guiding All Lore

### **Identity & Dissociation**  
The self becomes uncertain in VR.  
Memories may feel real even if generated.

### **Perception vs Reality**  
What pawns perceive matters more than the “truth”.

### **Soft Existential Horror**  
Not gore, not violence — but:
- Wrongness  
- Incompleteness  
- Uncertainty  
- Repetition  
- Echoes of unseen layers  

### **Hope & Escape**  
VR can be a sanctuary as much as a trap.

### **Archaeotech Mystery**  
Hints of older systems embedded in forgotten tech.

# 🧩 7. Canonical Elements to Use in Writing

The following building blocks are approved for writers:

### **Fragments of Ancient Code**
- “Segmented identifier strings”
- Missing or deprecated functions
- Corrupted comment blocks

### **Memory Echoes from Past Users**
- Unfamiliar landscapes  
- Names the pawn never heard  
- Recurring symbols  

### **Architectural Glitches**
- Wireframe geometry  
- Scene repetition  
- Out-of-sync avatars  

### **Cosmic Quiet**
A feeling that the VR space is too large, too empty, too patient.

### **Digital Doubles**
Copies of the pawn appearing:
- Slightly delayed  
- With reversed animations  
- Or missing facial expressions  

### **Internal Questioning**
Occasional system-generated queries:
- `ARE YOU STILL YOU?`
- `DO YOU REMEMBER OUTSIDE?`
- `WHO IS USING WHO?`

### **Subtle Reality Bleed**
- Seeing grid-lines in the real world  
- Hearing VR ambience outside the pod  
- Feeling watched by something without shape  

---

# 🌌 8. Non-Canonical / Forbidden Elements

Writers must **never** include:

### ❌ Concrete explanations  
No “the VR network is secretly a hive-mind AI.”

### ❌ Strong, explicit horror  
No monsters, gore, or violent hallucinations.

### ❌ “The simulation is controlled by X faction”  
No gods, demons, corporations, or storytellers behind it.

### ❌ Breaking the fourth wall  
No references to the player, modders, or coding jokes.

### ❌ Explicit metaphysics  
No final answers.

# 🧱 9. Writing Canon Guidelines (For AI & Humans)

### When writing memories or events:
- Prefer subtlety over revelation  
- Let pawns describe what they saw/felt  
- Avoid correctness or absolute certainty  
- Avoid detailed technical jargon  

### Use sensory language:
- Light  
- Sound  
- Texture  
- Rhythm  
- Silence  

### Avoid worldbuilding “infodumps”
Only fragments and impressions.

# 📘 10. Canonical Example Text (Reference)

### Minor glitch  
> *“The sky flickered like a candle. Just a breath of wrongness.”*

### Moderate glitch  
> *“I heard someone whisper my name, but the voice wasn’t loaded properly.”*

### Major glitch  
> *“The horizon folded inward, like the sim was turning itself inside out.”*

### Crisis glitch  
> *“For a moment I saw another world layered behind this one. I hope it wasn’t looking back.”*

# 🧩 11. Long-term Lore Intent (High-Level Only)

Future expansions may hint at:
- Archeotech origins  
- Lost civilisations using similar systems  
- Patterns shared between VR instabilities and psychic events  
- Group-dream anomalies  
- Past users leaving mental residue  

But these should remain **hints**, not answers.

---

# ✔ 12. Summary

Virtu-Awake’s lore is:

- Fragmented  
- Ambiguous  
- Experiential  
- Psychological  
- Archeotech-adjacent  
- Soft sci-fi  
- Never fully explained  

Writers must reinforce a world where:
**The truth is hidden, the boundaries are thin, and the only reliable thing is the pawn’s fear, wonder, or confusion.**
