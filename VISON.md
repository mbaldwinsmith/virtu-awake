### The Design Philosophy Behind **Virtu-Awake**

This document defines the *creative intent*, *aesthetic principles*, and *thematic boundaries* of the Virtu-Awake project.  
It is not about tasks or implementation details — it is about the **soul** of the mod.

All contributors (human or AI) should read this before making design decisions.

# ⭐ 1. Core Vision

Virtu-Awake aims to expand RimWorld with:
- Deep psychological storytelling  
- Immersive VR systems  
- Trait-driven emergent drama  
- Slow-burn sci-fi horror  
- Moral ambiguity and philosophical tension  

The mod should feel:
- RimWorld-native  
- Narratively rich  
- Surreal but grounded  
- Atmospheric and quietly unsettling  
- Focused on *pawn psychology*, not gore or shock  

It is a mod about **inner worlds**, **identity**, and **the fragility of reality** — told through RimWorld’s understated, dry humour and bleak charm.

---

# 🧠 2. Themes to Embrace

### **Identity & Perception**  
VR sessions should make pawns question:
- Who they are  
- What is real  
- What they feel  
- How their memories shape them  

The mod thrives on **subtle psychological shifts**, not loud spectacle.

### **Emergent Narrative**  
Stories should arise naturally from:
- Traits  
- Events  
- VR malfunction  
- Lucidity / Instability  
- Social VR interactions  

Players should discover stories by reading mood thoughts and watching behaviours — *not* scripted cutscenes.

### **Tension Between Comfort & Horror**  
VR offers bliss, training, recreation, escapism.  
But also glitching, distortion, and creeping awareness.

Both sides must coexist.

---

# ❌ 3. Themes to Avoid

Virtu-Awake should **never** include:
- Gore, splatter, torture descriptions  
- Graphic violence in VR memory text  
- Real-world branded references  
- Meta-breaking humour that ruins immersion  
- Loud jumpscare horror  
- Excessive technobabble  

The tone should remain **quiet, eerie, ambiguous, and narratively mature**.

---

# 🌀 4. Aesthetic Tone

Virtu-Awake’s style can be described as:

### **Soft Sci-Fi + Psychological Unease**  
Not cyberpunk.  
Not hard sci-fi.  
Not cosmic horror.  
More like:
- *SOMA (quiet dread)*  
- *Outer Wilds (mystery)*  
- *RimWorld’s dry comedy + melancholy*  

### **Subtle, Dreamlike, Fragmented**  
Glitches should:
- Hint  
- Suggest  
- Tease  
- Leave room for imagination  

No exposition.  
No explanations.

---

# 🧩 5. Gameplay Intent

### **VR Pods**  
Provide recreation, skill training, social encounters, and emotional relief — with flavour and charm.

### **Virtu-Dream Pods**  
Introduce moral grayness, colony management dilemmas, and psychological risk.

### **Awakening System**  
Creates dramas and slow-burn tension:
- Lucidity = awareness  
- Instability = cracking illusion  

Together they produce:
- Memories  
- Glitches  
- Personality shifts  
- Possible breakouts  

### **Breakouts**  
Not punishment.  
Not combat challenge.

They are **story moments** —
as meaningful as a mental break, a meltdown, or an inspired creativity event.

---

# 🎭 6. Trait Expression Intent

Traits should meaningfully alter VR experience:
- Psychopaths intrigued, not afraid  
- Body Purists disturbed by digital bodies  
- Too Smart pawns reverse-engineer reality  
- Sanguine pawns find joy in the surreal  
- Depressive pawns spiral deeper  

Trait interactions should produce:
- Unique memories  
- Legendary events  
- Rare narrative arcs  
- Different awakening pathways  

This system is central to the mod’s identity.

---

# 🕳️ 7. Horror Philosophy

Virtu-Awake uses **psychological horror**, not gore or violence.  
The horror should be:
- Uncertain  
- Liminal  
- Existential  
- Internal  
- Thought-provoking  

Good rules of thumb:

- *“Is the world behaving wrong?”* (Yes → good)  
- *“Is the pawn unsure whether they’re awake?”* (Yes → good)  
- *“Does the event leave space for interpretation?”* (Yes → good)  

Avoid anything explicit.  
The player's imagination should fill the gaps.

---

# 🧭 8. Design Priorities

Order of importance:
1. **Narrative coherence**  
2. **Psychological depth**  
3. **Trait reactivity**  
4. **Emergent gameplay**  
5. **Mechanical clarity**  
6. **Code quality**  
7. **Performance**  
8. **Visual polish**  

Never sacrifice narrative or psychological integrity for flashy mechanics.

---

# 🌿 9. Ethical Ambiguity

This mod explores:
- Escapism  
- Consent  
- Prisoner treatment  
- The ethics of simulation  
- Identity fragmentation  
- Survival-driven moral compromise  

It must **never**:
- Glorify abusive behaviour  
- Humiliate characters  
- Add cruel mechanics for shock value  

The tone should always be:
- Neutral  
- Observational  
- Grimly curious  
- “RimWorld-ish”  

---

# 🧩 10. Guiding Summary

**Virtu-Awake exists to tell the kinds of stories RimWorld excels at —  
but inside the minds of colonists.**

It is:
- Psychological  
- Emotional  
- Surreal  
- Emergent  
- Player-interpreted  
- Trait-driven  
- Quietly unnerving  

And most importantly:

**It must always deepen the player’s connection to their pawns.**
