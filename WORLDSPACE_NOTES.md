### How VR Environments Behave, Break, and Feel Inside **Virtu-Awake**

This document defines the rules, guidelines, and narrative principles for how **worldspace** inside Virtu-Awake simulations should look, act, glitch, collapse, or reveal itself.  
It supports writers and developers creating:

- VR memory text  
- SimType descriptions  
- Glitch events  
- Awakening-tier scenes  
- Lore fragments  
- Spatial anomalies  

Worldspace behaviour must remain surreal, psychological, and consistent with the Virtu-Awake tone.

# 🌐 1. The Nature of Virtu-Awake Worldspace

Virtu-Awake VR environments are **soft, responsive, and dreamlike**.  
They are not hard-coded 3D rooms — they behave like *memory palaces*, *constructed perceptions*, or *semi-organic mental landscapes*.

Worldspace should feel:
- Calm  
- Smooth  
- Minimalist  
- Symbolic rather than literal  
- Emotionally influenced  
- Loosely structured, not rigid  

### Never describe them as:
- Fully photorealistic  
- High-tech cyberpunk arenas  
- Arcade or videogame references  
- Earth sporting or entertainment simulations  

The world is **impressionistic**, not simulated reality.

# 🧩 2. Sensory Language For VR Environments

Use sensory cues that evoke:
- soft light  
- muted colour  
- ambient hum  
- distant echo  
- slight haze  
- smooth surfaces  
- gentle motion  

### Common motifs:
- shifting horizons  
- infinite looping paths  
- mirrored planes  
- faint reflections  
- slow drifting particles  
- geometric repetition  

All of these reinforce the *quiet surrealism* of Virtu-Awake.

# 🔄 3. How Worldspace Responds to Pawns

Simulation environments should subtly respond to:
- Mood  
- Traits  
- Instability  
- Lucidity  
- Recent events  

### Examples:
- Nervous pawns see “lag shadows” behind objects  
- Psychopaths notice structural seams without fear  
- Sanguine pawns find beauty in distortions  
- PsySensitive pawns feel emotional atmospheres  

Environments feel **alive**, but never explicitly sentient.

# 💫 4. Worldspace Stability & Instability

### **Stable VR Space**
- Continuous geometry  
- Consistent lighting  
- Smooth NPC animation  
- Calm ambience  
- Strong immersion  

### **Low Instability**
- Flickers  
- Repeated frames  
- Slight texture mismatches  
- Shadows lagging  
- Objects buzzing faintly  

### **Medium Instability**
- Looping corridors  
- Delayed avatar movement  
- Colour desaturation or tint shifts  
- NPC facial “emptiness”  
- Gravity softness (floating dust, slow fall)

### **High Instability**
- Wireframes breaking through  
- Horizon collapse  
- Geometry folding  
- Sound desync  
- Spatial stutter  
- Unreal perspective changes  

### **Critical Instability / Crisis**
- World “peels” or “folds open”  
- Blank voids appear  
- Terrain vanishes in sections  
- Depth perception breaks  
- Visual layering of multiple realities  
- Glimpses of outside the simulation  
- Unresolved presences  

These *must* be described through pawn perception, not objective reality.

# 🌀 5. Spatial Glitch Templates

When designing worldspace anomalies, use these templates:

### **Flicker-Shift**
A small part of the scene freezes or jumps a frame.

### **Loop-Cell**
The pawn turns a corner and returns to the same spot but not quite as they left it.

### **Parallax Drift**
Foreground objects move correctly, but background moves wrong.

### **Shadow Desync**
Shadows move out of sync with entities.

### **Wireframe Exposure**
Textures stutter, revealing geometric mesh.

### **Horizon Buckle**
Distant lines bend inward or ripple subtly.

### **Depth Collapse**
Objects appear 2D for a moment.

### **Silent Drop**
All ambient sound stops simultaneously.

---

# 🔮 6. Awakening-Tier Spatial Behaviour

Worldspace should change at each awakening tier:

### Tier 1 — Compliant  
- Comfortable, stable, warm  
- Flickers feel like “dust in the air”

### Tier 2 — Flicker  
- Repeated animations  
- Slightly out-of-place objects  
- Walls or trees snapping to new positions

### Tier 3 — Dissociation  
- Avatar delays  
- Rooms feel too large or small for a split-second  
- Edges of objects blur or “vibrate”

### Tier 4 — Realisation  
- Pawn sees “through” a texture  
- Brief silhouettes of the pod  
- Geometric understructure  
- Sky or space behind rendering layers

### Tier 5 — Breakthrough  
- Geometry peeling like paper  
- Multiple layers of reality misaligned  
- Direct impossible geometry  
- Black voids with faint motion  
(This must be subtle and symbolic, not cosmic horror.)

# 🧠 7. Trait-Specific Worldspace Reactions

Different traits shape world perception:

### **Psychopath**  
Finds oddities “interesting,” focuses on technical details.

### **Neurotic / Nervous**  
Notices distortions early, feels unsafe.

### **Sanguine**  
Sees beauty even in instability, finds colour shifts calming.

### **Depressive**  
Interprets glitches as symbolic decay.

### **PsySensitive**  
Feels presence, significance, emotional atmospheres.

### **TooSmart**  
Recognises patterns, identifies repetition, deduces structure.

### **BodyPurist**  
Disturbed by avatar distortions or floating limbs.

# 🛑 8. Forbidden Worldspace Descriptions

Do **not** describe:
- Literal machines generating the world  
- Visible computer code  
- Earth holograms, neon cyberpunk tech  
- Monsters, gore, bodily horror  
- Pop culture or “Matrix-like” moments  
- Explanations of who or what built the system  

Keep the mystery intact.

# ✨ 9. Example Worldspace Descriptions (Approved Tone)

### **Calm Simulation**
> *“The field stretched farther than it should, as if the horizon was painted on velvet.”*

### **Medium Glitch**
> *“The corridor flickered, repeating a single frame like a held breath.”*

### **Awakening-Tier**
> *“For a moment, the sky thinned into pale lines, as if something behind it was reaching through.”*

### **Crisis**
> *“The world folded inward with no sound, revealing a blankness that felt patient.”*

---

# ✔ Summary

Virtu-Awake worldspace must always feel:

- Dreamlike  
- Minimalist  
- Quiet  
- Symbolic  
- Uncertain  
- Trait-reactive  
- Never fully explained  

Its purpose is not to imitate reality —  
but to tell stories about minds under strain, comfort, or awakening.
