### Writing & Narrative Standards for **Virtu-Awake**

This Style Guide defines how all flavour text, memories, events, descriptions, and narrative elements in Virtu-Awake must be written.  
It ensures consistency, immersion, emotional coherence, and lore safety across the entire mod.

Virtu-Awake’s style is:
- subtle  
- psychological  
- dreamlike  
- ambiguous  
- grounded in RimWorld tone  
- never comedic, expositional, or sci-fi literal  

This guide is **mandatory** for all narrative content.

---

# 1. Core Tone Principles

All writing must follow these principles:

### **1. Quiet and Subtle**
Glitches, distortions, and revelations are **soft**, not dramatic.
- No loud drama.  
- No direct horror.  
- No action-movie intensity.

### **2. Psychological, Not Technical**
Events occur in perception, not in machinery.
- Never talk about code, software, servers, AI, engineers, or circuitry.  
- Never describe “programming errors” or “system failures.”  
- Distortion is emotional, cognitive, symbolic.

### **3. Dreamlike Ambiguity**
Pawns do not fully understand what they experience.
- Avoid explanations.  
- Avoid certainty.  
- Use sensory impressions over logic.

### **4. Thin Reality, Not Broken Machinery**
Perceptual seams are uncanny, not malfunctioning hardware.

### **5. RimWorld Authenticity**
Keep language in the RimWorld style:
- grounded  
- personal  
- lightly poetic  
- never modern-tech specific  

---

# 2. Language Guidelines

### **A. Use sensory, emotional language**
Prefer impressions:
- flickers  
- echoes  
- soft distortions  
- silence that feels inhabited  
- colours shifting subtly  

### **B. Avoid modern/real-world language**
Forbidden:
- “VR headset,” “software,” “program,” “rendering,” “GPU,” “AI,”  
- “simulation error,” “bug,” “lag spike,”  
- Earth idioms, memes, pop culture.

Allowed:
- “the world felt thin,”  
- “my reflection lagged behind,”  
- “the sky folded softly,”  
- “the silence changed texture.”

### **C. Keep sentences concise & atmospheric**
Memories should rarely exceed 1–2 lines.

### **D. No humour, no quips, no sarcasm**
This is not a comedic mod.

### **E. No meta-awareness**
Pawns never understand:
- that they are in a simulation  
- what technology powers the system  
- the nature or origin of the Underlayer  

---

# 3. Emotional Palette

### **Allowed Emotions:**
- curiosity  
- awe  
- unease  
- disorientation  
- quiet fear  
- quiet joy  
- melancholy  
- dissociation  
- wonder  
- recognition  
- confusion  
- longing  

### **Forbidden Emotions:**
- terror  
- rage  
- comedic amusement  
- exhilaration  
- heroic triumph  
- spite  

---

# 4. Glitch Representation Rules

All glitch text must follow:

### **Surface Glitches (Class-S)**
- flickers  
- doubled frames  
- minor sound shifts  
- soft visual repeats  

Tone: trivial, ignorable, questioning.

---

### **Structural Glitches (Class-T)**
- NPCs freezing  
- footsteps repeating  
- rooms subtly resizing  

Tone: uncanny, not frightening.

---

### **Cognitive Glitches (Class-C)**
- déjà vu  
- emotional echoes  
- mirrors misaligning  
- avatar desync  

Tone: personal, introspective.

---

### **Underlayer Glitches (Class-U)**
- silhouettes  
- soft void intrusions  
- perceptual “folds”  
- echoes of self  
- thin sky moments  
- glimpses of impossible geometry  

Tone: symbolic, profound, not explained.

---

# 5. Trait Variants

Trait-based variants:
- change tone and interpretation  
- never change the actual event  
- must stay subtle  

Examples:

**Neurotic:** anxious, anticipatory  
**Sanguine:** gentle wonder  
**Psychopath:** analytical curiosity  
**PsySensitive:** emotional resonance  
**Too Smart:** pattern analysis  
**Body Purist:** discomfort with avatar distortions  

---

# 6. Awakening Tone Rules

Awakening memories escalate emotional intensity, not action.

### **Tier 1 — Compliant**
Confusion; softness.

### **Tier 2 — Noticing**
Quiet recognition of seams.

### **Tier 3 — Dissociation**
Expanded awareness; self-detachment.

### **Tier 4 — Revelation**
Symbolic understanding; sensory layering.

### **Tier 5 — Rupture**
Identity fracturing; reality folding inward.

Never:
- talk about “escaping the simulation”  
- use sci-fi language  
- dramatise with aggressive action  

---

# 7. Event Writing Rules

### **Do:**
- Root events in personal perception  
- Use atmosphere and emotion  
- Keep voices soft, minimal  

### **Do Not:**
- Introduce antagonistic entities  
- Describe violent hallucinations  
- Make NPCs self-aware  
- Break RimWorld-style grounded voice  
- Use overt sci-fi explanatory monologues  

---

# 8. NPC Behaviour Tone

NPCs must always be:
- soft, calm, non-confrontational  
- slightly distant  
- simple and repetitive  
- symbolically uncanny as Instability grows  

NPCs never:
- threaten  
- scream  
- express strong emotions  
- explain anything  

---

# 9. Legendary Memory Style

Legendary memories must be:
- profoundly symbolic  
- deeply atmospheric  
- archeotech-inflected  
- impossible yet gentle  
- minimal and poetic  

They must **not**:
- reveal lore  
- explain secrets  
- provide answers  

Legendaries evoke **mystery**, not truth.

---

# 10. Forbidden Content List

Never include:
- gore, blood, violence  
- direct horror  
- monsters, demons, cosmic tentacles  
- overt “glitches” in the coding sense  
- any mention of Earth concepts  
- comedy, silliness  
- pop culture references  
- 4th-wall-breaking dialogue  
- expositional explanations of VR tech  
- AI/robots/software references  
- action-thriller scenes  

Virtu-Awake is quiet, psychological sci-fi from the *inside*.

---

# 11. Summary

All Virtu-Awake writing must be:
- dreamlike  
- symbolic  
- emotional  
- RimWorld-authentic  
- ambiguous but meaningful  
- soft yet uncanny  
- grounded in perception, not in tech  
- enriched by traits, instability, and awakening  

This guide ensures the entire mod speaks in one voice:  
**calm, surreal, psychological, and quietly profound.**
